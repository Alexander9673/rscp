# rscp
A control panel for rAthena made with rust

## Why another control panel?
PHP is slow, which is what FluxCp uses, and same as the other failed control panels made with other langs like NodeJS. I chose rust because rust is fast, as it compiles to `LLVM` which makes the code optimized. And yes the lang is a low-level lang, but this lang is considered "safe". Which means that memory problems will **rarely** happen.
